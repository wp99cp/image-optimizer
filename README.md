# Image Optimizer
 Optimize and scale images automatically for web usage.

In the ``options.js`` file, you can define the input types (.jpg, .png ...), set the output type and add an array of file sizes to be created.

Please make sure that you have installed ```node.js``` at Version `` 12.10.0``  (newer versions are not supported by the sharp module) and all the necessary packages with ```npm i``` first.



To start the process type ``gulp default`` into the console.
